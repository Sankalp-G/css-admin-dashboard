# Admin Dashboard
An admin dashboard UI made primarily with CSS grid layouting.

This exercise was specifically designed for practicing CSS grid-based layouts, resulting in the intentional use of the grid wherever possible. While this approach might appear counterintuitive, it proved to be a valuable learning experience.
